# weight-visualization-for-transformer-models
This repository contains a project that aims to replicate the weight visualization of CNNs for Transformer models.

The plan is to apply the techniques of this colab notebook https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19cmX6U70zovssqIbAJaWFUEWNu4AIZBF?usp=sharing#scrollTo=-vL6Uycfjsk0 on Transformers.  

Steps: 

- 1. Weight visualization for the expanded weights

- 2. Feature visualization for some tokens
